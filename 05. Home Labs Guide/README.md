## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of computer networks, operating systems, and general cybersecurity concepts. The minimum PC requirements to efficiently run a home lab are:

Processor: Intel i5 or equivalent
RAM: 8GB (16GB recommended for running multiple VMs)
Storage: 256GB SSD (additional HDD for data storage recommended)
Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS capable of hosting virtual machines

## Setting Up Your Lab

Hardware Requirements
To get the most out of your home lab, you should have a computer that meets or exceeds the following specifications:

Recommended Processor: Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7
Recommended RAM: 16GB or more
Recommended Storage: 500GB SSD or larger, with additional HDD for backups and large data sets

### Software Requirements

To fully equip your home lab, you'll need various open-source and free software tailored to different aspects of IT and cybersecurity. Below are categorized recommendations:

Download the ISO files for Kali Linux and Ubuntu.
Create new virtual machines in your virtualization platform, allocating at least 2GB of RAM and 20GB of disk space to each.
Install the operating systems on each virtual machine from the ISO files.
Install cybersecurity tools like Wireshark and Metasploit in your Kali Linux VM.

## Building Your Own Machine

If you are interested in building a custom PC for your home lab, consider the following components for optimal performance:

Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 or Intel i7
Motherboard: Ensure compatibility with the CPU and has enough PCI slots for expansions like additional network cards.
RAM: 16GB or more for multitasking and efficient running of multiple VMs.
Storage: Combination of SSD for the operating system and applications, and HDD for storing large data and backups.
Power Supply: At least 550W for future upgrades and expansions.

### GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance)
Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) are critical components of cybersecurity that ensure your practices align with established standards and regulations. This section provides a comprehensive overview of various GRC frameworks and resources, along with tools that can help you implement these concepts in your home lab.
