## Tips for Improving Your CV

### Language and Wording
- **Action Verbs**: Start bullet points with action verbs such as "engineered," "coordinated," "achieved," or "innovated" to clearly convey your contributions.
- **Quantifiable Achievements**: Use numbers to describe your achievements, e.g., "increased productivity by 30%" or "reduced downtime by 15%".
- **Tailored Language**: Customize your CV for each job application using keywords from the job posting to enhance relevance.

### What Recruiters Look For
- **Clarity and Organization**: Use a clear structure, headings, bullet points, and consistent formatting.
- **Relevant Skills and Experience**: Emphasize skills and experiences directly relevant to the job, including both technical and soft skills.
- **Professionalism**: Maintain a professional tone and keep content concise and focused.

### Ideal CV Length
- **Conciseness is Key**: Aim for a CV that is 1-2 pages long. For those with extensive experience or technical projects, up to 3 pages can be acceptable, but always prioritize conciseness and relevance.

### Showcasing Technical Skills
- **Dedicated Section**: Create a dedicated section for technical skills. List technologies, tools, and software you’re proficient with, organized by category (e.g., programming languages, software development tools).
- **Examples**: For each skill, provide a brief example of how you used it in a project or work context, showing application and impact.

### Aligning Skills with the Job Description
- **Skill Matching**: Carefully read the job description and identify key skills the employer is seeking. Align your CV’s language and highlighted skills with these requirements.
- **Customize Bullet Points**: Adjust the bullet points under each job or project in your CV to reflect the skills and experiences that match the job description.
- **Translating Non-IT Experience**: Explain how skills from non-technical roles are applicable to IT roles, such as problem-solving and project management.
- **Examples**: Include specific examples of how past experiences align with job requirements.

### How to List Your Projects
- **Selectivity and Relevance**: Only include projects relevant to the job. Detail the project's scope, your role, the technologies used, and measurable outcomes.
- **Links**: If applicable, include links to project repositories, demos, or documentation that provide further detail and showcase your work.
